# coffee-shop-bubble-sort
 
please, first read this repository's about.

The compiled code is inside out/production/LoginAndUserAccounts since this was made using Intellij Idea.

The enunciate for this project was the next:

A school's coffee shop has decided to do the serving of the kids that want to buy in order of age from minor to mayor so the youngest children are the first to be attended. Since the above is a new norm established by the coffee shop (aprobed by the school), the kids still don't know about it and everyone have gone out to break running, as always, to be first in row. The children are now in a different orden than the one required to fulfill the new norm and one of the servants of the coffee shop has been designated of sorting them properly to be able to start the service.
